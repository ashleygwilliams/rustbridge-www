First of all: Welcome to the RustBridge team! We have a very flat hierarchy, and
any person that's interested in organizing is very welcome in our ranks.

That being said, organizing a RustBridge event is much simpler than you might
think. What makes RustBridge events RustBridge events can be boiled down to
three points:

- The event has to be free
- The event has to be targeted towards underrepresented minorities in Tech
- The event has to follow the [Rust Code of Conduct](https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/conduct.html)

But apart from that, you can use any venue, use any curriculum, with as many
people as you want! Although we also provide materials specifically for people
who have never organized a RustBridge event before, so maybe you'd want to check
those out...
