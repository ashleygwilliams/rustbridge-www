# During the Event

On the day of the event, make sure you're at the venue early so you can get
everything set up. Having multiple teachers/mentors is recommended, but depends
on the size of your group. Set yourself a schedule that you'll follow during the
day, and be careful to meet the deadlines imposed by your venue. Other than
that, have a great time!
