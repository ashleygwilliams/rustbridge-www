## About RustBridge
{: .f2 .lh-title .mt5 }

RustBridge workshops are held all around the world, and specifically targeted
towards underrepresented groups in technology. The first RustBridge workshop was
held at [RustFest Berlin](https://2016.rustfest.eu/), and since then, it's
become a tradition of sorts to hold a workshop at every Rust conference
thereafter. Independently, RustBridge workshops have been held in 5 continents.
